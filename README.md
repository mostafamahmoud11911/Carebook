# 📘 CareBook – Booking Platform

A modern, seamless, and user‑centric booking platform designed to connect customers with service providers, supported by a powerful admin system. CareBook focuses on simplicity, speed, and a smooth end‑to‑end booking experience.

🟢 Customer Journey

CareBook offers a clean and intuitive experience, starting from discovering services all the way to booking confirmation.

Users can browse services from the home page, search and filter results, view detailed service information (images, pricing, offers, reviews), and book instantly using an interactive availability calendar. They can complete bookings as guests or via email/Google login, receive reminders, manage personal details, and submit reviews after appointments.

🔵 Provider Journey

Service providers can register and access a dedicated dashboard showing bookings, revenue, and reviews. They can add, edit, or delete services, set dynamic pricing and offers, manage availability with a calendar synced to Google Calendar, and organize all incoming bookings efficiently. Providers can also manage business information and policies for a professional presence.

🔴 Admin Journey

Admins get a full-scale control panel to monitor platform activity. The dashboard includes KPIs for users, providers, services, and bookings along with analytics charts and trends. Admins can manage user accounts, approve or decline providers, oversee all service content, and handle booking escalations and monitoring.
